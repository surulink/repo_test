GIT - Version control System - Free/Open source

If we have a file and if we are making any changes to the file often, thne we can have an vcs where all the changes have been tracked as versions 
and we can go back to any versions and see what changes have been made to the file and when.

1.Track changes done in files/folders
2.Collaborate in teams

CENTRALIZED AND DISTRIBUTED VCS

Centralized - Always online with the server which contains the repository and whatever changes made have been reflected to main repository always. 
             This will have a negative impact if something goes wrong when someone commit their changes.

Distributed VCS - pull a local copy of repository and each user can commit their changes to it and push the final update to main repository.

Github - a website to host all our repositories online

Github and Git are not equal

Git can be used with any repository system and Github can be used with any version control system


Workflow 

We can pull/clone a local copy of repositories 

We can make our changes in working copy, then using add command, all changes will be put in the staging area. Then using commit, 
changes have been put in local repository. Then using push, all the changes have been pushed to main repostiroy which is in the remote server.

Create a program / project in VCS
Start jenkins on port
Create a jenkins job
Add the program to git
Jenkins - Add git plugin
Configure jenkins job to trigger the execution when a change is pushed to git

Create a jenkins job 

	Create new item and name it and select freee style project
	Give commands to execute the program
	Build now and can see the output in console output


Add the program to git/github
	
	Initialize git - git init
	git status
 	git add . - to add files in the current directory
	git commit -m "added hello world program"
	it is committed locally and it has to be added to the remote repository, Now go to github
	create remote repository and give name, select public and create repository
	we will get location like http or ssh
	git remote add origin <location from git>
	git push -u origin master
	
Jenkins add git plugin 

	Go to Jenkins and add gitplugin from manage plugin
	Once added, go to project and click configure, then check Git and Poll SCM. Give schedule as when to execute this build
	Then check buld history for the latest action
	We can check by adding new files our project and check if any new items added to build history after doing git add and git commit
